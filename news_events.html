            <h3>Need</h3>
            <p>Mainstreaming sustainable ways of inhabiting this earth will require multiple economic and political transformations. It also requires new ways of doing knowledge production - and putting that knowledge to work. The concept of social learning points to a broad, collective learning process between communities, experts and governments (Berkes 2017, Keen, Brown and Dyball 2005, Schneidewind et al. 2016, Wals 2007, Collins and Ison 2009). It builds on transdisciplinarity by setting a more ambitious goal: you know you have social learning happening, when relatively passive knowledge moves into knowledge as (collective) doing. As an artist, farmer or anthropologist might say: you know that you've really understood something - when you can do it. Needless to say, this concept represents a complex ambition and highly dynamic field (Sol et al. 2013). It is, after all, a reformulation of a very big, old question: how do people, how do societies change peacefully? How can we effectively pursue intentional change in a non-violent manner?</p>

            <h3>Workshop Questions</h3>
            <p>There is of course no 'pure' digital commons: digitally-mediated relations are as complex and power-inflected as live interactions. Considering the key role of digitally-enhanced bridging platforms and networks in social transformation, there is therefore an urgent need to understand better their potential, risks and limitations. Given new digital and AI capabilities, how can we best understand and use these wisely, to support social learning?</p>

            <p>We invite attendees to address the following family of questions. These can be examined through the means of a classic academic paper or roundtable contribution. We also invite participants to exhibit and discuss their design of digital support-tools and principles for social learning.</p>

            <h4>Social learning theory</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How does social learning relate to antecedents such as action research and related fields, such as transformative learning, or U-Theory?</li>
                <li>Where do the limits of the social learning ideal show up, e.g. because of its origins in Euro-American academic and development policy contexts? What do we need to unlearn?</li>
                <li>What are the frictions and drawbacks in the ideal of social learning? How does the practice relate to more oppositional forms of struggle for emancipatory change?</li>
                <li>How can the goals, techniques and outcomes of social learning efforts be assessed?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Digitally-supported social learning</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What kind of digital technology and communication modes, what kind of networking activity can foster collective action over environmental justice concern?</li>
                <li>How do different sets of actors position themselves, for instance through on- and offline bridging devices, or in the creation and use of data repositories?</li>
                <li>What role does the creation of civic data play in social learning? How can this be digitally supported?</li>
                <li>How might digital modes reshape existing hierarchies and processes in struggles towards socio-ecological transformation?</li>
            </ul>
