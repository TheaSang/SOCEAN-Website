                <h2>A Social Learning Approach to <br> Global Marine Renewable Infrastructures</h2>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) technologies are being heavily promoted on European, Asian and American seaboards. These new ocean infrastructures are set to become a key part of sustainable energy transformations. Yet decades of experience with solar and wind parks have shown that green energy technologies are often beset with social and environmental justice concerns.</p>
                    <p>We therefore need to study the impact of marine renewables being established on global coasts with a methodology that actively brings academic research in to support resilient, socially-acceptable MRE design and deployment. Recasting the goal of research as social learning, this project purposefully bridges the divide between 'basic' and 'applied' research.</p>
                    <p>Social Ocean Energy (SOCEAN) takes a social learning approach in pioneering the first ethnographic study of marine renewable energy between coastal development hotspots in Asia and North America.</p>
